# Precision Marketing Through Customer Segmentation
## Project Problem Statement:
Developed a customer segmentation strategy to categorize customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) behavior, aiming to understand and target distinct customer groups effectively.
## Approach:

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Data was collected from an E-commerce dataset containing information about customer transactions, including details like product descriptions, quantities, invoice dates, and customer IDs.
The dataset underwent extensive preprocessing, which included handling missing values, removing canceled orders, and addressing outliers in quantity and unit price.
The 'Totalprice' feature was engineered by multiplying the 'Quantity' and 'UnitPrice' columns to represent the total amount spent by each customer.
### 2. RFM Analysis:

Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis was employed to quantify customer behavior.
Recency: Calculated as the number of days since a customer's most recent transaction.
Frequency: Represented the number of unique transactions for each customer.
Monetary: Signified the total amount spent by each customer.
These RFM scores were used to understand each customer's purchasing habits.

### 3. Customer Segmentation:

Customers were segmented into distinct groups based on their RFM scores.
A mapping dictionary was created to classify RFM score ranges into meaningful segments such as 'best,' 'faithful,' 'highest_paying,' 'most_loyal,' 'need_attention,' 'good,' and 'average.'
This segmentation allowed businesses to tailor their marketing strategies to meet the unique needs of each customer group.

### 4. Machine Learning Classification:

A machine learning approach was applied to predict customer segments.
Data was divided into training and testing sets, and models were trained using features derived from RFM analysis.
Several classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.
The accuracy of each model was assessed to determine the most effective approach.

### 5. Results and Achievements:

The project resulted in highly accurate customer segmentation, with Decision Tree and Random Forest models achieving accuracy levels exceeding 99%.
Customer segments, such as 'best,' 'faithful,' and 'average,' were created to guide marketing and sales strategies effectively.
By implementing this segmentation strategy, businesses gained valuable insights into customer behavior, allowing them to deliver targeted marketing campaigns, enhance product recommendations, and improve customer retention efforts.
The project showcased strong analytical and data-driven skills, demonstrating the ability to leverage data for improved business decision-making.
Conclusion:
The Customer Segmentation project successfully addressed the challenge of understanding and categorizing customers based on their purchasing behavior. By utilizing machine learning and RFM analysis, businesses can now personalize their interactions with customers, leading to improved customer satisfaction and increased revenue opportunities.
